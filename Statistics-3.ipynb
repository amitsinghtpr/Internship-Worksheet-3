    "10. What Is Bayes' Theorem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Bayes Theorem is the extension of Conditional probability. Conditional probability helps us to determine the probability of A given B, denoted by P(A|B). So Bayes’ theorem says if we know P(A|B) then we can determine P(B|A), given that P(A) and P(B) are known to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. What is z-score?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Z-score is also known as standard score gives us an idea of how far a data point is from the mean. It indicates how many standard deviations an element is from the mean. Hence, Z-Score is measured in terms of standard deviation from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. What is t-test?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is percentile?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:percentile is a term that describes how a score compares to other scores from the same set or the percentage of values in a set of data scores that fall below a given value.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. What is ANOVA?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:Analysis of variance (ANOVA) is a statistical technique that is used to check if the means of two or more groups are significantly different from each other. ANOVA checks the impact of one or more factors by comparing the means of different samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. How can ANOVA help?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:ANOVA is helpful for testing three or more variables. It is similar to multiple two-sample t-tests. However, it results in fewer type I errors and is appropriate for a range of issues.\n"
